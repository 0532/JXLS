        <section name="Export of a single collection into multiple worksheets" id="exportIntoMultipleSheets">
            <p>Sometimes it is required to export every collection item into separate worksheet. jXLS provides
            a special way to do this.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the following method of XLSTransformer class</p>
            <source>
 public HSSFWorkbook transformMultipleSheetsList(InputStream is, List objects, List newSheetNames, String beanName, Map beanParams, int startSheetNum)
            </source>
            <p>Here</p>
            <source>
 is             - InputStream for source XLS template file
 objects        - List of beans where each list item should be exported into a separated worksheet
 newSheetNames  - Sheet names to be used for newly created worksheets
 beanName       - Bean name to be used for a list item when processing sheet
 beanParams     - Common bean map containing all other objects to be used in the workbook
 startSheetNum  - Worksheet number (zero based) of the worksheet that needs to be used to create multiple worksheets
            </source>
            <p>Using of this method is simple. Here is an example</p>
            <source>
InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("multipleSheetList.xls"));
XLSTransformer transformer = new XLSTransformer();
List sheetNames = new ArrayList();
for(int i = 0; i &lt; departments.size(); i++){
    Department department = (Department) departments.get( i );
    sheetNames.add( department.getName() );
}
HSSFWorkbook resultWorkbook = transformer.transformMultipleSheetsList(is, departments, sheetNames, "department", new HashMap(), 0);
            </source>
            <p>In this example we export each department into a separate worksheet using the first worksheet as
                the main template for a single department export. Every sheet will be named as corresponding department name.</p>
